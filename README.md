  You need to create an app that will search images on Google by the query text.
Use serper.dev API to get the Google search result in a JSON format. After sign-up, you will
receive the API key with free 2500 requests:

https://serper.dev/

The main screen must contain a search field at the top where users can write the text for the
query. The resulting images must be shown below the toolbar as a collection view (e.g. recycler
view with grid layout manager, Jetpack Compose can also be used).

A tap on the preview image must open an image in the full screen view. Users can swipe
images for navigation between them on this screen. Also, please add a button to open the
original source page. Clicking on that button must open a website in an external browser or
Chrome Custom Tab inside the app.

Additionally, you can add transitions for shared elements in list and details screens.

API service also allows pagination for loading images. Please implement pagination on scroll.

It will be good if the images are cached on a device.
